# Speech-To-Text Tutorial

Learn how to do Speech-To-Text with Python and AssemblyAI! It just takes a few lines of code to transcribe your first audio file!

This example demonstrates how to:
- Upload an audio file
- Start the transcription
- Get and print the transcription result

## Environment variables

You'll need to set the API Key as secret in Replit to keep the application secure:

| Variable      | Description                                                                       | Required |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `API_KEY`     | AssemblyAI API Key. Create one for free [here](https://app.assemblyai.com). | Yes      |

After setting the API Key, you can simply run this Replit, inspect the code in `main.py`, and see how simple it is!
