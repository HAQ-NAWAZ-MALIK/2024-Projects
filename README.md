USER Prompt : *Create a detailed description for an image of a futuristic cityscape at night with flying cars and neon lights.*

LLAMA DISCRIOTION OUTPUT : *Flying cars, a ubiquitous sight in this futuristic metropolis, zip through the air with ease, their sleek, metallic bodies glinting in the neon light. Some are painted in bold, bright colors, while others feature intricate, holographic displays that seem to shift and change as they move. The cars are effortlessly maneuverable, swooping and diving through the city's aerial traffic with a precision that belies their seemingly impossible design.*
